# SSL Certs

We make use of Secure HTTP Only cookies in this project, therefore, you will need to make use of [MKCert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) locally for SSL certificates.

- Create certificates for your `localhost` domain
- Name the generated files `cert.pem` and `cert-key.pem` accordingly.
- Add the certificates to the `nginx/certs` folder.
